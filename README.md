# SPT-IFLï¼šNon-coding RNA Prediction and Decision Aid Platform Based on Deep Learning

SPT-IFL innovatively constructs a multi-modal deep learning framework for gene sequences, and achieves high-precision identification of non-coding Rnas by fusing sequence features and deep representation. This platform has three major technical breakthroughs:

1. Multi-modal architecture for agro-medical integration: Integrating mammalian (human, mouse) and plant ncRNA data, developing a fusion model containing 86-dimensional manually selected sequence modalities (k-mer, GC content, etc.) and deep representation, and improving the recognition accuracy by 12%-13% compared with traditional methods.

2.Stable learning strategy: innovatively designed weighted loss function system, while optimizing the relationship between feature dependence and sample, improves the generalization ability of the model.

3.Domain adaptation AI dialogue engine: accurately understand the terminology.

4. Implementation of dual-scenario engineering: deployed as an online service platform (http://www.sptifl-ncrnapre.com/).

SPT-IFL not only provides an interdisciplinary paradigm for ncRNA research, but also deeply integrates artificial intelligence into the national food security strategy, providing original technical support for smart breeding and high-quality agricultural development.
